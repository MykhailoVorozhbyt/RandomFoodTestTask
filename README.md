# RandomFoodTestTask
# This project adopts the MVI.
# MVI promotes a clear separation of concerns, dividing the application into: 
# - Model (responsible for business logic and data handling);
# - View (managing the user interface);
# - Intent (capturing user interactions). 
# This structured approach enhances maintainability and scalability.
